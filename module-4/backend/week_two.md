Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?
    * Classes are available in ES6 which are more reminiscent of other object oriented languages such as Ruby. 
2. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript? 
    * Synchonous Javascript executes line by line while asychronous allows other tasks to be completed while the rest of the JS is running.
3. What are the four pillars of Object Oriented programming?
    * Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
4. What are some tools available in JavaScript to help you write object oriented code?
    * Classes, Constructors, Prototypes
5. What are some key concepts to be aware of when refactoring your JavaScript?
    * Single Responsiblity and the abiltiy to unit test. Also organization is important for finding specific functionality.
6. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?
    * Callback functions occur when an event triggers it. We need them on event listeners to execute tasks once that event happens. 
7. What's the scope of variables in Javascript?
    * Variables are scoped wehre they are declared. If a variable is declared within a function, that variable would be scoped to that function.
8. What's the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
    * == is abstract equality that will not necessarily be the exact same. === is strict equality which will test if something is exactly equal to something else. 
9. Why do front end frameworks exist?
    * Front end frameworks exist to organize JS and make it easier to create applications that are consistent and organized.

10. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?
    * Because there is no information saved. Once the transaction is complete the connection is lost. 
11. Describe a RESTful API.
    * A RESTful API has the 7 main restful endpoints that users are able to access by visiting those URL endpoints. 
12. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
    * They will be working on all aspects of the program in small pieces. They will create the back end and front end for small piece before moving forward to something else. Instead of building the entire backend first before looking at anything else. They are also easily adaptable to change and can switch directions quickly.
13. What are some advantages **and** disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
    * Oauth makes it easy to login using already created accounts. It assumes users have that specific account. This could be a disadvantage if the user didn't have/want a twitter account for example.
