1. What's your favorite project management tool?
    * My favorite project management tool so far is waffle. I think pivotal tracker is more powerful but it seems to offer too much for the smaller scale projects I've been working on.
2. Why do we create staging environments?
    * Staging environments are created to make sure that code that doesn't work isn't accidentally pushed into a working production environment. It allows for checks and balances.
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
    * A good readme is concise and to the point, explains exactly what needs to happen in order to run the application, and explains how to contribute to the application. 
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
    * Good HTML class names is one way to improve accessibility so a browser is able to read to the client what is displayed instead of having to see it. 
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
    * You want to be aware of SSL and HTTPS which secures data being transferred between computers. 
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
    * Continuous Integration allows checks for errors frequently allowing developers to fix issues early before they become more difficult to catch. 
7. What are some continuous integration tools?
    * TravisCI is a continuous integration tool and so is Circle CI and GitLabs CI

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
    * A good git workflow includes frequent commits. Also simulates staging environments so nothing gets pushed to master that shouldn't be in production. Good conversation between team members is also important. 
9. What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?
    * Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
10. What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?
    * A module is a way to abstract relatable code into its own file. A module doesn't have state whereas a class does.
